## Hello! I'm Atharva Kulkarni

Welcome to my personal website! I'm an aspiring economist and data scientist currently pursuing advanced degrees in both fields.

### Education & Background

I am currently pursuing:
- **M.Sc. in Economics** at Symbiosis School of Economics, Symbiosis International University (expected 2026)
- **B.Sc. in Data Science and Applications** from Indian Institute of Technology - Madras (expected 2027)

I have completed:
- **B.A. in Economics (Hons)** from Indira Gandhi National Open University (2024)
- **B.Sc. in Economics (Hons)** from Indian School of Business and Finance, University of London (2023)

### Professional Experience

I recently completed an internship at Symbiosis School of Economics, Pune (May-July 2025), where I:
- Validated the performance of an advanced STD-ConvLSTM model on the PEMS dataset
- Engineered complete data ingestion and processing pipelines using Apache Spark and PyTorch
- Optimized model hyperparameters and implemented robust evaluation frameworks

### What I'm Passionate About

I'm passionate about bridging the gap between economic theory and practical data applications. I enjoy working on projects that combine statistical rigor with real-world problem solving.

When I'm not analyzing data or studying economic models, I enjoy exploring new technologies and methodologies that can enhance economic research and analysis.

### Get in Touch

Feel free to explore my projects, interests, and blog posts to learn more about my work. I'm always open to discussions about economics, data science, and their intersection!
