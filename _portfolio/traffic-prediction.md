title: "Traffic prediction on PEMS dataset using a Spatial-Temporal Dependent Convolutional LSTM model [_work in progress_]"
excerpt: >
  <div class="portfolio-excerpt portfolio-excerpt--blue">
  Currently implementing a novel deep learning approach for traffic prediction using the PEMS (Performance Measurement System) dataset. 
  This research implements a *Spatial-Temporal Dependent Convolutional LSTM (STD-ConvLSTM)* model that captures both spatial dependencies 
  between traffic sensors and temporal patterns in traffic flow.
