## Dissertation Overview

This is my dissertation topic where I’m analyzing the convergence hypothesis — the idea that poorer countries should eventually catch up with richer ones in terms of income, productivity, and development. Using large cross-country datasets like the Penn World Table, Maddison Project, World Bank indicators, and even novel measures such as satellite night-time lights, I’ll test different forms of convergence: absolute, conditional, and club convergence. I’ll also compare specific country pairs (for example, South Korea vs. Japan) to see how similar economies have evolved differently. The project combines classic growth theory with modern econometric techniques to evaluate whether the world economy is really moving toward greater equality or fragmenting into persistent clubs.
